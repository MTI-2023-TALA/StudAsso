Since the health crisis, the associative life has had difficulty in relaunching itself and the multiplicity of the communication platforms makes the whole chaotic.

The Stud'Asso project aims to relaunch and simplify communication between associations and students.Â But also to simplify the management processes of associations, from recruitment to the publication of events, all customizable by the user.

Moreover, the application will simplify the exchanges between the associations and the administration in order to allow the latter to obtain a simple vision of all the associations through statistics.
